Translates JSON into a Go type definition. [Check it out!](http://mholt.github.io/json-to-go)

This is a sister tool to [curl-to-Go](https://mholt.github.io/curl-to-go), which converts curl commands to Go code.

Things to note:

- The script sometimes has to make some assumptions, so give the output a once-over.
- In an array of objects, it is assumed that the first object is representative of the rest of them.
- The output is indented, but not formatted. Use `go fmt`!
